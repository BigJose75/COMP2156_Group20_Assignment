COMP 2156 DevOps For System Administration
==========================================

DevOps emerged from the collision of two major related trends. The first was called “agile infrastructure” or “agile operations”; it sprang from applying Agile and Lean approaches to operations work.  The second is an expanded understanding of the value of collaboration between development and operations staff throughout all stages of the development lifecycle when creating and operating a service, and how important operations has become in our increasingly service-oriented world

DevOps is the practice of operations and development engineers participating together in the entire service lifecycle, from design through the entire development process all the way to deployment and production support.

DevOps is also characterized by operations staff making use of many of the same techniques as developers for their systems work, and development staff creating applications designed to work well in an operational environment.

DevOps Engineers should be involved in the software development process from the very beginning.
 This way, they can monitor performance testing, production status, security, version control, and updates,
 increasing the speed and quality of your project development.

The Role of a DevOps engineer in a software development life cycle

A DevOps engineer introduces processes, tools, and methodologies to balance needs
 throughout the software development life cycle, from coding and deployment, to maintenance 
and updates. Maybe you want to shift your career to DevOps, or train yourself to drive adoption 
within your company.
